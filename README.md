Ian's Stock Portfolio

Playing with the Stock Market, by Ian Rappaport


Project Purpose

The purpose of Ian's stock portfolio is to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a site where the user can look at their stock portfolio, determine their historical returns, and do research to make future trades. The user will be able to input the current stocks they own, how many shares, and get an overview of their portfolio.  There will be a page for research, a page for their current portfolio, and a page for the most recent stock news of the day.  This app will be for people who are overwhelmed by Etrade or other financial apps, with simple, easy to read info.  

  
APIs

I am using IEX stock API which has access to tons of information.  I image I may have to use a second API, like Yahoo Finance, for certain formation as well. 

Features

I will have to build a homepage with a bit of information on how to use the site.  I'll have to build a research page that will take information a user asks for and displays it in a user friendly format.  I will also want to build some type of drop down that will allow for specific info to be displayed for each stock.

Another page will be to input the user's stock portfolio.  Using a table possibly, The user will enter the stock, the number of shares, and from that the site will generate their market value and some other information.  At the bottom, there will be an aggregate of the user's entire portfolio.  

A third page will be stock news of the day.  There will be headlines at the top, and an ability to focus on specific sectors (technology, media, etc).  

Stretch Goals

Making the site look as professional as possible.  Design is not my strongsuit, so I believe I will have to spend a ton of time in this department.

Possibly another page with personal finance information you can input and see how much leftover money you have to make trades. For example, input takhome pay of 100 a week, expenses 75, savings 15, and 10 leftover for stocks.  Would have to expand on this.
